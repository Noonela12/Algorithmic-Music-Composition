Algorithmic Music Composition System
Overview
This project implements an algorithmic music composition system using Markov Chains and Genetic Algorithms to generate musical compositions. The system evolves transition probability matrices for pitches, rhythms, and chords to produce high-quality musical pieces. It includes functionality for generating compositions, evaluating them with genre-specific motives, and exporting results in MIDI and MusicXML formats.

Features
Markov Chains: Generate musical sequences based on transition probability matrices for pitches, rhythms, and chords.
Genetic Algorithms: Evolve musical compositions through selection, crossover, and mutation.
Genre-Specific Motives: Tailor compositions to specific musical styles by incorporating predefined or generated motives.
MIDI and MusicXML Export: Save compositions in formats suitable for playback and analysis in digital audio workstations or music notation software.
Requirements
Python 3.x
